This library allows you to use WiFi capabilities of Arduino boards equipped with NINA module. Its source code can be found at 
`this Github page <https://github.com/gershnik/BetterWiFiNINA>`_

It is a fork of `WiFiNINA <https://github.com/arduino-libraries/WiFiNINA>`_ library that attempts to improve it and fix longstanding issues
to make it usable for more serious network communication needs.

The library supports WEP, WPA2 Personal and WPA2 Enterprise encryptions. 

To use this library:

.. highlight:: cpp

::

   #include <SPI.h>
   #include <EvenBetterWiFiNINA.h>
   


The following pages describe various aspects of the library functionality:

* :doc:`WiFi` - connect to/establish a WiFi network and various global functionality
* :doc:`Socket` - a safe interface to BSD-style sockets. Use this interface if possible.
* :doc:`BearSSLSocket` - using sockets with Bear SSL. Use this interface if possible.
* :doc:`MbedTLSSocket` - using sockets with Mbed TLS. Use this interface if possible.
* :doc:`UDP` - a simplified interface to UDP. 
* :doc:`Client` - a simplified interface to plain TCP and SSL clients. Only useful for client SSL connections and otherwise deprecated.
* :doc:`Server` - don't use

Various examples can be found `here <https://github.com/gershnik/BetterWiFiNINA/tree/mainline/examples>`_.
